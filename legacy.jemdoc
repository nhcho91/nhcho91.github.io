The Aerospace Autonomy and Intelligence Laboratory (AAIL) represents the third generation of a preeminent academic lineage at Seoul National University. AAIL proudly carries forward the academic tradition of the Flight Dynamics and Control Laboratory (FDCL), an intellectual powerhouse that shaped the trajectory of aerospace control research in South Korea for seven decades. Building upon the standards of excellence established by our predecessors, AAIL integrates the precision of traditional control engineering with the transformative power of modern computing.
