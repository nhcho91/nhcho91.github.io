== Short Bio
Namhoon Cho is a research fellow in the Centre for Autonomous and Cyber-Physical Systems, School of Aerospace, Transport and Manufacturing, Cranfield University, United Kingdom, since January 2021, where he has been awarded a Cranfield 75th Anniversary Fellowship. He received his BSc and PhD degrees in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Seoul National University, South Korea, in August 2012 and February 2017, respectively. Previously, he was a senior researcher in the 1st R&D Institute, Agency for Defense Development, South Korea, from March 2019 to December 2020, where he was involved in research and development of guidance and control systems for missiles and developed design tools based on optimisation techniques. He was a research fellow in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, South Korea, from March 2017 to February 2019. He develops constructive methodologies for the design and analysis of control and estimation systems, with a particular emphasis on autonomous aerospace vehicles. His research interests include coherent integration of learning and control on the basis of optimisation, robust adaptive control methods based on online model learning, applications of machine learning algorithms to problems in control and estimation, unified frameworks for automated design of optimal guidance and control systems, and online trajectory optimisation.
